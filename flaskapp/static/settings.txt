trashbots settings are applied only to the server they are configured in

the command used to configure or view settings in a guild is 't!settings <setting> <subcommand> <value>' 
in this case, <setting> is a keyword for a configurable setting, <subcommand> is a subcommand, and <value> is a value for a setting (if any)

a list of configurable settings is as follows:

	prefix		:	custom prefix
	msgchannel	:	channel to send join/leave/ban messages to
	joinmsg		:	content for the guild join message
	leavemsg	:	content for the guild leave message
	bansmsg		:	content for the guild ban message


using the settings command without any setting provided will output a list with all the configured settings for the server

leaving the subcommand blank after a setting will output the contents of that setting (if any) 
supplying the subcommands "set" or "reset" after a setting will allow you to manipulate the contents of that setting

when using the "set" subcommand, you can supply a value in which the given setting will be set to
when using the "reset" subcommand, the provided setting will be reset to default (which usually means deleting it)

here is an example of the settings command being used to set, view, and reset a custom guild prefix:

	t!settings prefix set t?
	"prefix set to 't?'"
	
	t!settings prefix
	"the current guild prefix is 't?'"

	t!settings prefix reset
	"prefix set to 'default'"


some settings are special cases in terms of how their values can be set
take "msgchannel" as an example; if the value is a channel mention or ID, the value will be set to that channel. if the value is left blank, it will be set to the channel the command was used in instead. 

	t!settings msgchannel set #general
	"set the events message channel to #general!"
		
	t!settings msgchannel set
	"set the events message channel to the current one!"


some settings have special parsing/formatting for their values, such as the join message
lets say you want the join message to mention the user, show their ID, and say the name of the server; that would be done like this:

	t!settings joinmsg set [@user] ([user-id]) welcome to [server]!
	"join message set!"
	
so when a member joins, this is what will be sent to the event messages channel:

	"@eli#0631 (216635587837296651) welcome to trash man hangout!"
